# Alternative Storage Fix Solutions

## Error: "must be owner of table objects"

This error occurs because you don't have direct access to modify the storage.objects table in Supabase's managed environment.

## Solution 1: Use Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Storage Buckets via Dashboard
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Storage**
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Create bucket with name: `profile-images`
   - Set as **Public bucket**: ✅ Yes
   - File size limit: `5242880` (5MB)
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif`
4. Create another bucket: `project-images`
   - Set as **Public bucket**: ✅ Yes  
   - File size limit: `10485760` (10MB)
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/gif`

### Step 2: Set Storage Policies via Dashboard
1. Go to **Storage** → **Policies**
2. For each bucket (`profile-images` and `project-images`), create these policies:

**INSERT Policy:**
- Policy name: `Allow authenticated uploads`
- Allowed operation: `INSERT`
- Target roles: `authenticated`
- USING expression: `true`
- WITH CHECK expression: `true`

**SELECT Policy:**
- Policy name: `Allow public access`
- Allowed operation: `SELECT` 
- Target roles: `public`
- USING expression: `true`

**UPDATE Policy:**
- Policy name: `Allow authenticated updates`
- Allowed operation: `UPDATE`
- Target roles: `authenticated` 
- USING expression: `true`

**DELETE Policy:**
- Policy name: `Allow authenticated deletes`
- Allowed operation: `DELETE`
- Target roles: `authenticated`
- USING expression: `true`

## Solution 2: Simplified SQL (If you have access)

If you have elevated permissions, try this simpler approach:

```sql
-- Only create policies (don't try to create buckets)
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Public Access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id IN ('profile-images', 'project-images'));

CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Authenticated Upload" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id IN ('profile-images', 'project-images') AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Authenticated Update" ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE USING (bucket_id IN ('profile-images', 'project-images') AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Authenticated Delete" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id IN ('profile-images', 'project-images') AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## Solution 3: Disable RLS Temporarily (Quick Fix)

If the above doesn't work, you can temporarily disable RLS for testing:

```sql
-- Disable RLS on storage.objects (TEMPORARY - for testing only)
ALTER TABLE storage.objects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

⚠️ **Warning**: This makes all storage objects publicly accessible. Only use for testing!

## Solution 4: Check Current Policies

First, let's see what policies already exist:

```sql
-- Check existing storage policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';

-- Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';
```

## Recommended Approach

1. **Try Solution 1** (Dashboard method) first - it's the safest
2. If that doesn't work, **try Solution 4** to check current state
3. **Try Solution 2** with the simplified SQL
4. As a last resort, **try Solution 3** temporarily

## After Fixing Storage

Once storage is working, test the profile picture upload. The code changes I made should prevent the blank page issue:

- Profile pictures auto-save after upload
- No more page reloads
- Better error handling
- Context refresh instead of full page refresh
